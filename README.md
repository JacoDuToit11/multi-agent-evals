# Developing Evaluations for Multi-Agent Systems

We start with relatively complex games that require agents with specialized skills, cooperation, and strategic planning between agents. Our goal is to extend this into a general framework that can be used to model realistic deployment scenarios of multi-agent systems.

Games we are looking at so far:
1. [The Captain is Dead](https://board-games.fandom.com/wiki/The_Captain_Is_Dead)
2. [Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_(board_game))
